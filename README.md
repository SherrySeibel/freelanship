#Freelanship

######This is the prototype for Freelanship, a service that connects students to project-based internships.

#The birth of Freelanship

Freelanship was born during the 2014 Boston [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/)

With only 52 hours of brainstorming and technical development, the Freelanship prototype was demonstrated 
to a panel of judges where it was .2 points away from placing. 

#The demonstration

Several pages were included in the demo, including the landing page, sign in page, and search results.

Students are able to search for the skills they wish to learn during an internship. They are then shown internship listings relevant to their search, with those listings and companies rated by other interns based on whether or not the company delivered on teaching them those skills. When a student clicks on a listing, a detailed description is revealed.

#Improvements

Currently, the only thing persisting to the databse is users. While some tables have been built, they were not incorporated into this demo. This is something to add in the future.
